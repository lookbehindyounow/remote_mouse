- fix idle timeout 30s issue - request custom supervision timeout from CoreBluetooth client?
- make buttons in app to start & stop server, or some kind of loop that runs it as soon as bluetooth is enabled
- make the ui better
- experiment with setting connection priority/latency - seems like this can't be done in Android from gatt server or in CoreBluetooth at all?
    try this:
        gatt_instance = device.connectGatt(autoclass('org.kivy.android.PythonActivity').mActivity, False, gatt_server_callback)
        gatt_instance.requestConnectionPriority(priority_level)
- experiment with bluetooth 5.x if not already using it - can't on my macbook, probably can't on my phone either
