- fix idle timeout 30s issue - request custom supervision timeout from CoreBluetooth client?
- make buttons in app to start & stop server, or some kind of loop that runs it as soon as bluetooth is enabled
- investigate if anything funky's still going on with the orders of the buttons
- experiment with setting connection priority/latency
- experiment with bluetooth 5.x if not already using it
- make the ui better
